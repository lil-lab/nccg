While India is ready to enter into a " defense cooperation agreement " with Sri Lanka , it is wary of being drawn into any military involvement in the island nation 's two decades - old civil war that has seen violent strife between ethnic Tamils and the Sinhalese majority - leaving over 60,000 dead on both sides .

At this point , our IT contacts are backpedalling a bit and suggesting they can overcome the TIBCO and Terminal Server problems .
ADP DET NOUN PUNCT PRON NOUN NOUN AUX VERB DET NOUN CONJ VERB PRON AUX VERB DET NOUN CONJ NOUN NOUN NOUN PUNCT

There are still four important issues , however :
PRON VERB ADV NUM ADJ NOUN PUNCT ADV PUNCT

IT still can not commit to transferring messages across domains .
NOUN ADV AUX PART VERB ADP VERB NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT

This means that messages initiated at Corp and intended for the entire Enron organization will not reach any business units outside the Corp domain .
DET VERB SCONJ NOUN VERB ADP PROPN CONJ VERB ADP DET ADJ PROPN NOUN AUX PART VERB DET NOUN NOUN ADP DET PROPN NOUN PUNCT

No messages will reach the EES organization unless IBM agrees not to use their proprietary message delivery tool , WebSphere , and will use WebLogic instead .
DET NOUN AUX VERB DET PROPN NOUN SCONJ PROPN VERB ADV PART VERB PRON ADJ NOUN NOUN NOUN PUNCT PROPN PUNCT CONJ AUX VERB PROPN ADV PUNCT

WebLogic is required by BackWeb , although it is designed by a separate company .
PROPN AUX VERB ADP PROPN PUNCT SCONJ PRON AUX VERB ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT

HR , intended to be a key user of this tool , will not use BackWeb because survey responses can not be made anonymous .
NOUN PUNCT VERB PART VERB DET ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT AUX PART VERB PROPN SCONJ NOUN NOUN AUX PART AUX VERB ADJ PUNCT

HR has already purchased a tool called CONFIRMIT that can execute anonymous surveys .
NOUN AUX ADV VERB DET NOUN VERB PROPN DET AUX VERB ADJ NOUN PUNCT

Messages will not be delivered simultaneously to all users in the same domain , nor will they be delivered for two to five hours after they are sent by the message administrator .
NOUN AUX PART AUX VERB ADV ADP DET NOUN ADP DET ADJ NOUN PUNCT CONJ AUX PRON AUX VERB ADP NUM ADP NUM NOUN SCONJ PRON AUX VERB ADP DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT

Another thing to consider is that these messages will be set to expire and disappear within a set period of time , meaning users can not retrieve them and read them later -LRB- as they can with e-mail -RRB- .
DET NOUN PART VERB VERB SCONJ DET NOUN AUX VERB ADJ PART VERB CONJ VERB ADP DET VERB NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT VERB NOUN AUX PART VERB PRON CONJ VERB PRON ADV PUNCT SCONJ PRON AUX ADP NOUN PUNCT PUNCT

This means that I could be away from the office for several days and miss a message entirely , because it would have expired and disappeared by the time I returned .
DET VERB SCONJ PRON AUX VERB ADV ADP DET NOUN ADP ADJ NOUN CONJ VERB DET NOUN ADV PUNCT SCONJ PRON AUX AUX VERB CONJ VERB ADP DET NOUN PRON VERB PUNCT

The plain fact is that a few members of IT are pushing this initiative , but they lack commercial sponsorship .
DET ADJ NOUN VERB SCONJ DET ADJ NOUN ADP NOUN AUX VERB DET NOUN PUNCT CONJ PRON VERB ADJ NOUN PUNCT

They are hoping Corp will foot the bill for a pilot which will allow them to fully test this tool before implementing it company - wide .

Adding all the Enron " Specified Entities " would only make a default under a financial transaction with those other Enron entities a default under this agreement .

Our concern is that we do n't want any trading related defaults to ever trigger a default under a loan transaction which has a swap as a component .

If you do add all the entities , does that mean that we would not need to put in place a separate agreement for ECCL ?

With respect to Deutsche Bank -LRB- "" DB " -RRB- , we have one credit issue remaining , DB would like us to add all the Enron trading entities DB trades with as Specified Entities under the ISDA Master Agreement and we are somewhat hesitant to do so , as this could potentially roll up swaps under structured loan transactions into a default under the ISDA Agreement .

As you know , the suffix ONLINE is purely descriptive and now used by many companies .
SCONJ PRON VERB PUNCT DET NOUN NOUN VERB ADV ADJ CONJ ADV VERB ADP ADJ NOUN PUNCT

Therefore , any trade mark registration that incorporates the word ONLINE as a suffix in the way that you use it will not enable its owner to prevent others from using the word ONLINE .
ADV PUNCT DET NOUN NOUN NOUN DET VERB DET NOUN NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADP DET NOUN ADV PRON VERB PRON AUX PART VERB PRON NOUN PART VERB NOUN ADP VERB DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT

Given the above , if you have adequate protection for the word ENRON -LRB- which covers the services that you offer on - line as well as your core activities -RRB- , I 'd say that another application for the words ENRON ONLINE is probably unnecessary .

Article 6 of the Gallup Compression Services Agreement -LRB- which I am sending to you separately -RRB- with ECS obligates ECS to " work in good faith with CDEC " to establish an automated system that would automatically have alerted us to peak loading conditions on CDEC 's system .

We had a pretty good idea when we signed the contract that ECS would not be able to complete that by the contract start date , so we negotiated a fall back plan under which ECS is obligated to " assist [ Transwestern ] in developing a manual system to accomplish the same result and will hold harmless and keep [ Transwestern ] whole for all cost and expenses " associated with the manual system .

I just got done looking at the underlying contract language as set forth in the pro forma service agreement in the tariff and it specifically says that the max rate would apply unless a discount or negotiated rate has been agreed to .

The difficulty lies in the fact that the confirmation system reads the counterparty 's name from Global Counterparty .

My suggestion is that Global Counterparty use the same name that the customer has signed on the EnronOnline Password Application -- my understanding is that the EnronOnline team returns inappropriate Applications to the customer until they are correctly completed .

In this particular case since the counterparty is still not allowed to transact on EnronOnline almost a month after sending in their application they are understandably upset and are now complaining .

Yes , GCP provides the links to establish the correlation between the parent and child for our downstream systems .

GCP procedure is to create Counterparty names that reflect either the Tradename / Division name or Parent Name -- not both simultaneously .

* Provides for vintaged Redwood path rates for core customers . *

* Offers a 7.5 cent / dth rate to large customers while minimizing rate changes to other customers , minimizing the incentive for these customers to seek to bypass local transmission charges and other CPUC - approved charges . *

instead of suggesting a specific rate increase - 10 or 15 % , I think we should acknowledge that a " modest " increase may be necessary and may in fact be desirable - but that the specific amount of increase should be reasoned and subject to well thought out evidence and hearings , not just determined by whim .

following up on our discussion yesterday ; for these types of deals , i do nt think it s necessary to have all the documentation of our counterparty 's authorization to enter into the agreement .
VERB ADP ADP PRON NOUN NOUN PUNCT ADP DET NOUN ADP NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX PART VERB PRON VERB ADJ PART VERB DET DET NOUN ADP PRON NOUN PART NOUN PART VERB ADP DET NOUN PUNCT

these are short term transactions and requiring this documentation will cause us to lose business because competitive alternatives do not have such burdensome requirements .
DET VERB ADJ NOUN NOUN CONJ VERB DET NOUN AUX VERB PRON PART VERB NOUN SCONJ ADJ NOUN AUX PART VERB ADJ ADJ NOUN PUNCT

the primary reason we need these things is for the scenario where a muni does a derivative deal with an open - ended downside , loses $ 50 million , and then claims that it was not a valid contract .

in our case , they are only hedging .

we are collecting a premium up front and their total cost is known up front .

Please note the following as you review :
INTJ VERB DET VERB SCONJ PRON VERB PUNCT

1 . The short forms do not contain the optionality relating to our performing billing services -- all of our midmarket forms anticipate that we will act as customer 's billing agent and that we will collect all amounts due related to T&D and the like from the customer -LRB- and reflect same on our invoice -RRB- and pass those amounts on to the customer 's utility .

2 . I did not include a " Setoff " provision in this draft , mainly because the vast majority of the time , we will not , nor will an affiliate , have another agreement in place with these customers .

If you feel strongly about our including a setoff provision , we will do so .
SCONJ PRON VERB ADV ADP PRON VERB DET NOUN NOUN PUNCT PRON AUX VERB ADV PUNCT

3 . The change in law provision reads a bit differently from the long form -- the thinking here is that the long form language is very lengthy and rather harsh -LRB- and we 've had great difficulty selling it in the past -RRB- .

The investigative committee , headed by state Sen. Joe Dunn , D - Santa Ana , is focusing on a series of events last fall filled with enough Shakespearean plot twists and intrigue that it has earned a name around the Capitol : " the palace coup . "

Lawmakers and consumer groups allege that the events - directed by the man who heads the state 's energy grid - fueled the California energy crisis , pushed the state into the power - buying business and helped make billions of dollars for power producers .

The central question behind the palace coup is whether Terry Winter , the president of the Independent System Operator , acted alone when he took steps to remove key price caps designed to limit the amount power generators could charge .

But Samuel Alito believes in a little - known Constitutional theory - called the " Unitary Executive Theory " - which says that the President should have complete control over the Executive Branch , and that the Executive Branch should be in charge of almost everything that the Government actually does , including the functions of the Independent Agencies which were designed to be free of Presidential control , and the Military , which exists , which is regulated , and which is funded by specific authority given by the Constitution to Congress , not to the President .

In part because of that reputation , the gray wolf was nearly exterminated from the lower 48 states by the 1920s , except for a small remnant population on Isle Royale National Park in Michigan 's Lake Superior .

Some recent research conducted by Oregon State University has given considerable credence to this idea .
DET ADJ NOUN VERB ADP PROPN PROPN PROPN AUX VERB ADJ NOUN ADP DET NOUN PUNCT

OSU forestry professors William Ripple and Robert Beschta have found that wolves actually promote stream - bank stabilization , although they have given the phenomenon the unfortunate name of " the ecology of fear " -- something that smacks of the horrible PR resulting from the wolf 's relationships with Riding Hood and the Three Pigs .

They explained that elk in Yellowstone used to browse unmolested on young aspen and willow growing near the banks of streams , a behavior that prevented the saplings from reaching mature stages and increased the possibility of soil erosion .

Since reintroduction , however , Ripple and Beschta have found , fear of the wolves apparently has discouraged the elk from spending too much time at stream banks -- where they are out in the open -- and munching on the saplings .

Although the origins of a movement that was confined largely to the literate culture of intellectual endeavor and patronage can be traced to the earlier part of the 14th century , many aspects of Italian culture and society remained largely Medieval ; the Renaissance did not come into full swing until the end of the century .

The word renaissance -LRB- Rinascimento in Italian -RRB- means " rebirth " , and the era is best known for the renewed interest in the culture of classical antiquity after the period that Renaissance humanists labelled the Dark Ages .

The High Renaissance period is traditionally taken to begin in the 1490s , with Leonardo s fresco of the Last Supper in Milan and the death of Lorenzo de' Medici in Florence , and to have ended in 1527 with the sacking of Rome by the troops of Charles V .

You need to purchase what is called a shoulder point harness .

To answer your questions in order :

1 -RRB- It is not normal for dogs to be vomiting , much less to have blood in it .
X PUNCT PRON VERB PART ADJ SCONJ NOUN PART AUX VERB PUNCT ADV ADV PART VERB NOUN ADP PRON PUNCT

However , if they have been vomiting numerous times , then the blood could be due to irritation of the stomach and intestines .

3 -RRB- If he shows no interest in water , then take him back to your vet .

It could be due to nausea or any number of things .

He could become severly dehydrated -LRB- especially if he continues to vomit and have diarrhea -RRB- .

Let me try to break this down as simply as I can : diurnal -LRB- active during the day time -RRB- reptiles like the bearded dragon require 3 types of " light , " UVA , UVB , and heat .

UVB on the other hand can only be reproduced by a fluorescent source .
